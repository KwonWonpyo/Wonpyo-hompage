# Intro

Indeed, I studied Antenna Engineering in my Graduates course and was quite good at designing and measuring the antenna array system. However, for my military duty in Korea, I now work as a Software Programmer. I am a front-end developer of [TamxOffice](https://www.tmax.co.kr/tmaxoffice), providing office software solutions for governments, education, and businesses. I am developing the "SuperWord," which is word-processor of Superoffice. I am particularly interested in video games and band music. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

My military duty at TamxOffice will end in March 2024. After that, I am free to move and would find a new job.

# Some history

- I was born in Pohang City and finished whole school curriculum at Pohang only (from elementary to Master's course). POSTECH was the closest university from my home.

- My childhood dream was to be a police officer. I couldn't imagine myself being a programmer. I became a programmer because of my military service.

- I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Maplestory, Metal Assault(a.k.a GigaSlave), and Nova1492.

- At 12, I learned Visual Basic and built my first calculator. At that time, I confused the difference between integer 1 and character '1'.

- At 13, I went to the English Camp at Handong University. It was my first college visit and shocked by that everyone speaks in English. Except me.

- At 16, I failed to enter the science high school. In the end, I applied for random-assign system and entered my high school which I've never heard before.

- At 16, I play the bass guitar for the first time. I think that moment changed my life significantly.

- At 18, I visited POSTECH for the advanced science course and decided I would apply POSTECH because the enginieering demostration was fantastic.

- In the colleage, I joined the Student Club Association and worked for 4 years. Eventually, I was elected to the Chairman of POSTECH Student Club Association at 23. 

- In my SCA Chairman year, I planned three festivals in the campus. spring campus festival, a new athletic competition with Science Institute Union, a new Halloween Party with student clubs. That's why my college grades are disastrous.
